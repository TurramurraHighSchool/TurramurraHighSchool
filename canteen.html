		At THS we are very proud of our Canteen. <br><br>

		We are a modern, self-service canteen dedicated to providing a varied selection of fresh, high quality, nutritional food to our students and staff. <br><br>

		We endeavour to satisfy our 1200+ customers a day with a large choice of meals at affordable prices. As well as staple items on the menu, we offer a large variety of seasonal daily/weekly specials throughout the year. Our range includes vegetarian and gluten free (GF) options every day. <br><br>

		The input of the student body is essential to the running of our canteen. Led by the student council Canteen Management Squad, student volunteers assist with food preparation each morning, and our cash registers are staffed by students at recess and lunch, every day of the week. Student leadership is also critical as our canteen continues to improve and grow, with students having direct input into our always evolving menu and the overall direction and management of our canteen.
