			At Turramurra High School our emphasis on creativity in computing has enabled many students to commence rewarding careers in related industries. The skills they have acquired have been in demand in web-based, film and multimedia industries. <br> <br>

			Our facilities are used extensively and much creative work is completed outside the timetable with teachers mentoring students. All students have secure server access and password protected storage. <br> <br>

			The school has four computer resource rooms and numerous workstations throughout the school. <br> <br>

			The school ensures that the computer hardware that students are using is regualrly upgraded and imporoved and, as a result, our resource rooms have the latest workstations with fast Internet access at all times.
