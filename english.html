		The study of English encourages students towards personal excellence in the use of the English language.  The English teachers at Turramurra High School are committed to addressing the cognitive, social and emotional needs of all students in the school. For that reason we are active in all areas of school life. We believe that English should not only concern itself with the development of skills in reading, writing, listening, viewing and speaking, but should also equip young people with the skills they need in order to articulate and reflect upon their concerns, their fears, their beliefs and their position in the world. We believe that English is vitally concerned with the development of the personality and accordingly we have designed challenging programs for our students.
