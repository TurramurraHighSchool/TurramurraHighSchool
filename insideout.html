		'Inside Out' aims to bring the whole community together to create an innovative and inspirational outdoor learning environment at Turramurra High School. We want to build an outdoor learning area that is stimulating and engaging and which creates spaces for students to work individually as well as collaboratively. This involves the major excavation of an area in the school grounds, followed by the building of a number of features including a sandstone amphitheatre, outdoor kitchen, seating areas for groups and for quiet reflection, an outdoor chess board, a vegetable garden and other garden beds with mass plantings of native plants and grasses. The area could accommodate up to 90 students at one time and would be available to all subject areas.
