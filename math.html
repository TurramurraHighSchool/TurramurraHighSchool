		At Turramurra High School we ensure support for all our students by offering the full range of courses. Although in Year 7 students are in core classes, we ensure the right support is provided for all students through well thought out lesson plans. Online tools such as MathsOnline and Mathspace are utilised to support and extend all students across the school. In Year 8 students are partially streamed based on their abilities. This provides the opportunity to extend our mathematically exceptional students while providing better and a more direct support to those students who need it.
