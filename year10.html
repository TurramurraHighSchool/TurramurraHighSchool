		Year 10 is an important year in many ways. Students are able to gain valuable insights into planning for their future through our Work Experience program and ‘Giving Back’ student volunteering program. Every Year 10 student gains enormous  benefit of regular careers lessons which assist them in the practical skills of preparing a curriculum vitae but also help with goal setting and discerning a pathway for their future. <br> <br>

		Year 10 is a year where we encourage students to develop independence of thought and action, to take responsibility for their own learning and continue to develop the important study skills for their senior years of high school.
