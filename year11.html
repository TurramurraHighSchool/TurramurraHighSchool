		Year 11 marks the commencement of the Higher School Certificate qualification.  Students will start their Preliminary HSC year with a combination of courses that they have selected for themselves from the broad range of curriculum choices on offer at Turramurra High School. <br> <br>

		As a member of the North Shore Secondary Schools Partnership, students at Turramurra High also have the opportunity to choose courses that may be offered at another of the schools in the partnership thereby expanding the curriculum choices exponentially.  Our partnership with Killara, Ku-ring-gai, St Ives and Chatswood High Schools means that our students gain the combined expertise and resources of five high schools rather than one.
