	Placement in Year 7 at Turramurra High School is highly sought after by families in our wider community.  Year 7 is an exciting year of transition and new opportunities for our students. <br><br>

	We offer a range of orientation activities for new students including an outstanding peer support program where student leaders in Year 10, mentor our new Year 7 students and assist them to get to know each other and our great school.
