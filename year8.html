		Year 8 at Turramurra High School is a year characterised by growth and change as our students continue to build on the skills and knowledge in each key learning area. <br> <br>

		Our Year 8 students are actively involved in our band program, singing groups and seek leadership opportunities on the Student Representative Council (SRC). Year 8 is a year where we encourage students to make the most of all the opportunities offered to them at Turramurra High School.
